Task 1 - An algorithm asking a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were input

Pseudo Code
request a positive integer from the user
while the integer is greater than zero 
	store the input as a variable
request another positive integer form the user
if the new integer is greater than variable
	save over the old variable with the new integer
repeat until the integer input is zero
	print out the variable


Task 2 - algorithm that requests a user input their name then stores the name in a variable called first_name. Subsequetly the algorithm should print out the first_name along with the phrase "Hello World"

Pseudo Code
request the user's first name
store the input in a variable called first_name
print first_name and "Hello, World"

Task 3 - an algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average

Pseudo Code
set the variable called total to zero
set the variable called counter to one
until the user inputs zero
	input an integer
	add the integer to the variable total
	add one to the counter
calculate the average by dividing total by counter and store as variable average
print average

Task 4 - an algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products  (in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy

Pseudo Code (got the idea for using list from chatgpt)
request the user input their grocery list
	store the items in a list called grocery_list
request the user input the items they have added to their cart
	store the items in a new list called added_items
compare the two lists and remove duplicate items from grocery_list
sort grocery_list into alphabetical order
print grocery_list


Task 5 - an algorithm for the flowchart diplayed on the website

Pseudo Code
request user enter an integer and store it as variable X
request user enter an integer and store it as variable Y
calculate X + Y and store as variable S
calculate S / 2 and store as variable A
calculate X * Y and store as variable P
print S
print A
print P
